## Implementation Notes

When implementing a design from one of these templates:

1. Review the project structure to ensure compatibility with our architecture
2. Check the state management approach used in the template
3. Adapt the UI components to match our existing style guidelines
4. Ensure all necessary screens from our requirements are covered
5. Extract reusable components for consistency across the app

## Design Guidelines

When adapting these designs to our application:

- Maintain consistent color scheme based on our brand colors
- Use standard spacing and typography as defined in our `dimens.dart` file
- Ensure accessibility standards are met
- Follow material design principles for interactive elements
- Maintain responsive layouts for different screen sizes
